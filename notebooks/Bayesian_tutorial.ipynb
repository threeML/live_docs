    "# Bayesian Posterior Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Bayesian posterior sampling, we want to the posterior, ${\\rm P}(M(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert D)$, of the model ($M(\\vec{\\theta})$)  given one or more datasets ($D$) (i.e., plugin instances) and one model containing one or more sources with free parameters $\\vec{\\theta} $ given a likelihood $L(\\vec{\\theta}) = {\\rm P}(D \\vert M(\\vec{\\theta}))$ and prior ${\\rm P}(\\theta)$ on the parameters. Only the simplest posteriors allow for an analytic solution, thus we must rely on Monte Carlo or nested sampling methods to sample the posterior. \n",

    "In 3ML, we currently provide two popular posterior sampling methods: [emcee](https://github.com/dfm/emcee) and [MULTINEST](https://github.com/farhanferoz/MultiNest). If you installed via conda, both packages are available, otherwise, only emcee is included.\n",

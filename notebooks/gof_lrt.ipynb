    "## Likelihood Ratio Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential part of MLE analysis is the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for comparing models. For **nested models** (those where one is a special case of the other), [Wilks' theorem](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177732360) posits that the LRT is $\\chi^2$ distributed, and thus the null model can be rejected with a probability read from a $\\chi^2$ table. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, this would always hold, but there are many regualrity conditions on Wilks' theorem that are often violated in astromonical data. For a review, see [Protassov et al](http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/571/1/545/) and keep it close at heart whenever wanting to use the LRT. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, in 3ML we provide a method for computing the LRT via profiling the null model via bootstrap samples. This is valid for nested models and avoids the dangers of asymmptotics and parameters defined on the extreme boundries of their distributions (spectral line normalizations, extra spectral components, etc.). This method does not avoid other problems which may arise from systmatics present in the data. As with any analysis, it is important to doubt and try and prove the result wrong as well as understanding the data/instrument.\n",

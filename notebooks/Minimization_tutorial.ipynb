    "# Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a Maximum Likelihood analysis we want to find the maximum of the likelihood $L(\\vec{\\theta})$ given one or more datasets (i.e., plugin instances) and one model containing one or more sources with free parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$. Most of the available algorithms for function optimization find the minimum, not the maximum, of a function. Also, since the likelihood function is usually the product of many probabilities, bounded to be $0 < p < 1$, $L(\\vec{\\theta})$ tend to be very small. Hence, it is much more tractable numerically to deal with the logarithm of the likelihood. Therefore, instead of finding the maximum of the likelihood $L$, we find the minimum of the $-\\log{L(\\vec{\\theta})}$ function. Of course, the values of $\\vec{\\theta}$ minimizing $-\\log{L}$ are the same that maximize $L$, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "argmax$_{\\vec{\\theta}}~\\left( L(\\vec{\\theta}) \\right)$ = argmin$_{\\vec{\\theta}}~\\left(-\\log{L(\\vec{\\theta})}\\right)$.\n",

    "## Local minimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the existing optimization algorithms are local minimizers (MINUIT, Levenbergâ€“Marquardt, Netwton...).\n",
    "A local minimizer starts from the current values for the free parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ and try to reach the closest minimum of a function $f(\\vec{\\theta})$ (in 3ML this is usually the $-\\log{L}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many minimizers are based on the idea of gradient descent, i.e., they compute the local gradient of $f(\\vec{\\theta})$ and follow the function along the direction of steepest discent until the minimum. There are however also gradient-free algorithms, like for example [COBYLA](http://www.pyopt.org/reference/optimizers.cobyla.html). While going into the details of how each algorithm works is beyond the scope, we illustrate here an example by using the Minuit algorithm."
